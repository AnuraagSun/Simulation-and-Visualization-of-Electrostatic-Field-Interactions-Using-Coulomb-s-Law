# Simulation-and-Visualization-of-Electrostatic-Field-Interactions-Using-Coulomb-s-Law
This project will simulate and visualize electrostatic fields from multiple point charges using Coulombâ€™s Law, focusing on applications like semiconductors, antennas, and sensors. We'll build a Python tool with NumPy for calculations, Matplotlib for field visualization, and Plotly or Tkinter for interactive charge placement
